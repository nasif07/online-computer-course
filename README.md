- ### Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project?
  Ans: Local state is data we manage in one or another component. Local state is most often managed in React using the useState hook. In general, itâ€™s important to keep my state as simple as possible and avoid nesting too many objects or arrays inside it. This will make it easier to reason about and debug my code.
